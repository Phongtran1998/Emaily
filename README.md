This is a full stack application built with React, Redux, Redux Form for Front-End, 
Node/Expressjs, Passportjs, Mongoosejs for Back-End
and I use MongoDB for Database.

If you want to use try this app, clone this project and run "npm install"
to download all of the dependencies. Then you need to keys for each of these services.


`googleClientID

googleClientSecret

mongoURI: register this on mlab

cookieKey: Any random string

stripePublishableKey

stripeSecretKey

sendGridKey:

redirectDomain: "http://localhost:3000"`

Create a dev.js file in config folder and module.exports an object with these key properties and that's it
